## Reflection

### 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.

-It was hard to at first if the function was working properly. Using unit testing
 helped a lot with that.
-Understanding function documentation was tricky but I understood it after I made
 the first function.
-Not a challenge/issue but the reusability of functions saved a lot of time and
 typing.

### 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.

-First challenge was to understand the syntax of the unit testing which seemed
 rather complicated at first.
-Unit testing helped me a lot to understand if my functions were working 
 as intended by testing them for various types of errors.
-Unit testing saves time by not having to type too much code to test functions
 in the main program. Instead you can test out each function for various errors
 and test if the function works when the input is valid.
